# Blender animations

This is a repository to show of some of my animations made using Blender used to either visualize a concept or draw interest from a viewer. I use my Blender skills to make sometimes boring or hard-to-understand interesting and understandable. 

# Animations I made for my master thesis:

## Animation to draw attention and interest
